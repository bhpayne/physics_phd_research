Judges did not understand what effect evanescent channels have on propagation.
-effect on refractive index?
-how one would expect transport to change qualitatively when evanescent channels are present

The picture of electric field intensity did not display well on the projector.

SVN 1075 got second place ($200)

Dr Silvius: although time constraints make it difficult,
1) tell the audience what you are going to say
2) tell the audience the message
3) tell the audience what you said

Ben's take-away:
Although a "logical flow" of question-answer is nice, it does not convey the message if the audience is not used to the topic. These two approaches should be combined: the audience first knows what is going to be the answer, and then the body of the talk is spent following the logical steps in question-answer format.

Dr Story: picture of distribution of conductance P(g) was not clear. Instead of x-axis "g", write out "conductance." And isn't that supposed to be transmission since we're talking about photons? The fact that it was a histogram was not clear, since Story didn't realize that a distribution (P(g)) was being described. Explaining "distribution of conductance" in first slide was too long ago to remember.

Ben's take-away: 
0) label axis with words if possible
1) explain how the information being plotted was found
2) explain the significance of the plot

Dr Story on my CV:
-I list a paper as "submitted". To where? Specify the journal
-specify conference dates (not just the year)
-Northwestern and Yale presentations: specify that these were to collaborators, not colloquiums.

Dr Parris: The system has an effective Hamiltonian, modes = eigenvalues. Then scatterers are added, how does that change the modes? 

Dr Vojta: what is the effect of evanescent channels in passive media? Dr Vojta did seem to realize that gain would be different.


Next time:
-use a video to record (for personal review)
-repeat back the question explicitly. This confirms to the asker that you heard the question. It's also to tell the audience what you're going to answer.
